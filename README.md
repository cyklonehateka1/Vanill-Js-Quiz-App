This is a simple app built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It contains just ten questions. 
Users can take the quiz to enhance their basic JavaScript and general programing skill. 
The basic and first version was built as my end of semester project at Takoradi Technical University 
Will be adding sign up features and the ability to select a subject or programming language of choice to narrow questions down to that your choice.
